# You-Never-Go-Full-Bayesian

# Script
This script contains basic Machine Learning Algorithms
* Gaussian Discriminators
	* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
	* Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
* Linear Regression
* Ridge Regression
* Gradient Descent for Ridge Regression
* Non-Linear Regression

# Dataset
Two data sets are provided:
* A 2D sample data set in the *sample.pickle*
* A medical data set *diabetes.pickle* 
	* The input variables correspond to measurements (**physical, physiological, and blood related**) for a given patient
	and the target variable corresponds to the level of *diabetic* condition in the patient. It contains:
		* xtrain (242 x 64) and ytrain (242 x 1) for training.
		* xtest (200 x 64) and ytest (200 x 1) for testing.
# Plots
Contain the plots produced from the script.
